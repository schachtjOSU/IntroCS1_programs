** Files **
findMode.cpp
smallSort2.cpp
Sphere.hpp
Sphere.cpp
sphereMain.cpp
makefile

** Compiling **
Each of the files included in this file have been compiled using Visual Studio 2013.  You could also compile the files using gcc.  It should be noted, the files should not be compiled together, but as seperate programs.  To compile them all at once, I was provided with a makefile from the course which is included.

** findMode Program **
This program will ask the user for the number of values to be entered.  The user will enter the values in and the mode value(s) will be displayed.  To do so will create dynamic allocated memory to store the array of integers.

** smallSort2 Program **
This program will ask the user for three numbers and will print out the original order.  Then, assigning those values as pointers, will pass to a function and sort the values in acsending order.

** sphereMain Program **
This program will be using classes to create a Sphere object.  The user will input the radius of the sphere and from there, the program will caluclate the volume of the sphere and output the result for display.  Also uses the Sphere.cpp and Sphere.hpp files for implementation.
