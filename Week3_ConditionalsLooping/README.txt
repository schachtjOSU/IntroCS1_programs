** Files **
rangeSum.cpp
numGuess.cpp
maxMin.cpp
matterState.cpp
fileAdder.cpp
Makefile
nums.txt

** Compiling **
Each of the files included in this file have been compiled using Visual Studio 2013.  You could also compile the files using gcc.  It should be noted, the files should not be compiled together, but as seperate programs.  To compile them all at once, I was provided with a Makefile from the course which is included.

** rangeSum Program **
This program takes two integer numbers and then adds all integers between them.

** numGuess Program **
This program will generate a number at random between 1 and 100 (inclusive).  The user will be asked to guess the number till he/she gets it right with hints on how close along the way.  Upon guessing the right number, the program will the user how many guesses it took to get the right number. 

** maxMin Program **
This program will ask the user how many numbers they would like to enter.  The program will have the user enter in that many values.  After all numbers have been entered, the program will display the smallest and largest of those numbers.

** matterState Program **
This program takes a temperature (integer) submitted by the user and will output the state of the substances with the given temperature.

** fileAdder Program **
This program will read an input file(nums.txt) with double value integers and add all the integers together into a total variable.  The total variable will written into an output fiel(sum.txt)
