** Files **
Book.cpp
Book.hpp
Library.cpp
Library.hpp
Menu.cpp
Patron.cpp
Patron.hpp
makefile

** Compiling **
Each of the files included in this file have been compiled using Visual Studio 2013.  You could also compile the files using gcc.  It should be noted, the files should not be compiled together, but as seperate programs.  To compile them all at once, I was provided with a makefile from the course which is included.

** final project Program **
This program will be using classes to create a Library object.  The user will be able to make adjustments to the Library through a Menu until exiting the program.  The Menu.cpp file is the main file for the program with the following as supporting files Book.cpp, Book.hpp, Library.cpp, Library.hpp, Patron.cpp, and Patron.hpp.
